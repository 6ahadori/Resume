              <p>
                BrainGoMo is at the forefront of a revolutionary approach to
                neurofeedback training. The company is dedicated to developing a
                mobile neurofeedback platform that empowers patients to engage
                in their training outside of clinical settings. This pioneering
                solution encompasses an innovative smartphone application,
                state-of-the-art hardware, and an interactive web server.
                Initially, BrainGoMo's innovations are designed to benefit
                individuals with ADHD, a demographic for which neurofeedback is
                a scientifically validated and established training method. It
                is noteworthy that neurofeedback offers distinct advantages over
                traditional medication, as it is entirely free from side
                effects. The startup is currently based within the Institute of
                Biomagnetism and Biosignal Analysis at the University Medical
                Center in Münster. BrainGoMo is proud to receive support for its
                endeavors through funding provided by Start-Up Transfer.NRW in
                conjunction with EFRE.
